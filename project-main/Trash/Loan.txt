Dependents:
Meaning: This represents the number of people financially dependent on the applicant.
It includes children, spouses, or elderly family members who do not have an independent income.

| Value | Interpretation           |
| ----- | ------------------------ |
| `0`   | No dependents            |
| `1`   | One dependent            |
| `2`   | Two dependents           |
| `3+`  | Three or more dependents |

Why it's important:

More dependents → higher financial burden → may reduce the chance of loan approval.
Used by banks to assess the repayment capacity of the applicant.


CoapplicantIncome:
Meaning: Income of the co-applicant (if any), such as a spouse or family member who is also applying for the loan along with the main applicant.

It's measured in Indian Rupees (₹), just like ApplicantIncome.

If there's no co-applicant, this value will be 0.

Why it's important:

A co-applicant with a steady income increases the total household income, which:

Can improve loan eligibility
Helps in approving larger loan amounts
Reduces risk for the bank

| ApplicantIncome | CoapplicantIncome | Total Income | Dependents | Loan\_Status |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| 5000            | 2000              | 7000         | 2          | Y (Approved) |
| 4000            | 0                 | 4000         | 3+         | N (Rejected) |

In the first row, coapplicant helps increase total income, and fewer dependents make the loan more likely to be approved.
In the second row, a single low income and many dependents reduce approval chances.


ApplicantIncome:
The values in ApplicantIncome are in Indian Rupees (INR).


Loan_Amount_Term:
The Loan_Amount_Term column in your loan prediction dataset refers to:
🔹 The duration of the loan – i.e., the number of months over which the loan will be repaid.
| Loan\_Amount\_Term | Meaning               |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| 360                | 30 years (360 months) |
| 180                | 15 years              |
| 120                | 10 years              |
| 60                 | 5 years               |
| 36                 | 3 years               |
| 12                 | 1 year                |


understand how applicantincome co-applicantincome and loan amount term is matching each other. (Is the amounts are in rs only or whatever is is.)
correcting the api in postman and check wheather it is running or not.
create the backend endpoint where the data will go and evaluate using the ml model.
